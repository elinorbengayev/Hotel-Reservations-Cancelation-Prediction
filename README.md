Intro:<br>
This project is the final project of the "Introduction to Machine Learning" course at the Faculty of Engineering in Tel Aviv University, as a part of the BS.c degree 'Digital Sciences for High-Tech'.
In this project we received a large data set file containing various features (known and anonymous) of hotels reservations and a label for each one of whether the reservation was canceled.
The aim of the project is to predict whether a given reservation will be canceled or not using machine learning models.
The project contains visualisition, data exploration, pre-processing, running differnt models and evalute them in order to choose the best performing one.
